# ♟️ Chess-Database-For-Robot

A Chess Database Management System designed to support a robot that plays against users using historical chess game data.

## 📚 Overview

**Chess-Database-For-Robot** is a backend-focused project that uses a structured MySQL database to store and manage chess games, player profiles, and move data. It includes a custom PGN parser to extract games from `.pgn` files and populate the database automatically.

This project is designed to power a robot (or AI system) that can query the database in real-time to play intelligently against human users by learning from past strategies.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗃️ **MySQL Database**: Stores detailed game records, user profiles, and individual moves.
- 📥 **PGN Parser**: Parses Portable Game Notation (.pgn) files and inserts complete game data into the database.
- 👤 **User Management**: Stores usernames and related metadata for tracking player history.
- 🤖 **Robot Ready**: Designed to support move suggestions and strategy selection using stored historical games (AI integration ready).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component       | Technology        |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Database        | MySQL             |
| Backend         | Python            |
| Data Format     | PGN (Portable Game Notation) |

## 🔄 How It Works

1. Upload a `.pgn` file containing one or more chess games.
2. The PGN parser reads and extracts metadata (players, results, moves, etc.).
3. All game data, including usernames and moves, is inserted into the MySQL database.
4. The robot (or AI engine) can then query the database to retrieve openings, strategies, or full games to inform its next move.

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- 🔍 Implement a chess engine interface for real-time decision making.
- 🧠 Add analytics on player performance and game statistics.
- 🖥️ Build a web or GUI interface for easier data upload and visualization.
- 🤖 Integrate with a physical or virtual robot for live gameplay.
